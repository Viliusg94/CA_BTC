# Issue Resolution Summary

## Issues Resolved

1. **Syntax Error in `model_manager.py`**:
   - Fixed unclosed curly brace (`{`) in the CNN model configuration
   - Line 86 was missing a closing brace and had formatting issues

2. **Syntax Error in `new_endpoints.py`**:
   - This file had severe formatting issues with code being jumbled
   - Created a fixed version of the endpoints in `fixed_endpoints.py`
   - Ensured proper imports for database models

3. **Endpoint Function Name Conflicts**:
   - Fixed duplicate endpoint function names causing conflicts:
     - Renamed the second `stop_training` to `stop_training_endpoint` in `training_api.py`
     - Renamed the third `stop_training` to `stop_model_training` in `training_api.py`
     - Renamed the second `train_model` to `start_model_training` in `model_api.py`
     - Renamed the second `list_models` to `list_models_files` in `model_api.py`

## Validation
All files now pass syntax checks and the application should start without the previous errors.

## Next Steps
1. Start the application to verify that it runs correctly
2. If there are any runtime errors, they should be handled separately
3. Consider implementing a code linting process to prevent similar issues in the future

## Note
This fix addressed the syntax errors and endpoint conflicts, but there might be other issues that could appear at runtime. If any new issues appear, they should be addressed promptly.
